A Doctrine of Design: Realigning Next-Generation Air Dominance for the USAF and U.S. Navy
Executive Summary
The United States is at a critical juncture in defining its air power for the latter half of the 21st century. The U.S. Air Force’s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program and the U.S. Navy’s F/A-XX program are poised to consume hundreds of billions of dollars to field the platforms that will succeed the F-22 Raptor and F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. This report contends that the current development paths for both programs are fundamentally flawed, representing a dangerous inversion of each service’s core air power doctrine. The result is a trajectory toward two compromised, doctrinally misaligned, and exorbitantly expensive weapon systems that will be ill-suited for the challenges of a peer conflict.
The Air Force, whose doctrine has for generations prioritized the attainment of pure air superiority as the prerequisite for all other military action, is pursuing an NGAD concept (herein designated "F-47") that blends the roles of a frontline "killer" with a back-end command-and-control "hub." This approach dilutes its primary air dominance mission and creates a high-risk single point of failure. Conversely, the Navy, whose operational reality aboard aircraft carriers has always demanded multi-role versatility, is pursuing an F/A-XX concept that appears to be a specialized, high-performance air superiority fighter. This path ignores the fundamental engineering penalties of navalization, which will critically compromise the aircraft's performance and stealth while failing to deliver the versatile workhorse the fleet requires.
This analysis proposes a fundamental realignment of these programs to conform with sound doctrine and engineering principles. This alternative force structure is based on specialization and purpose-built design:
For the U.S. Air Force: A Disaggregated Air Dominance System. Instead of a single, compromised "F-47," the USAF should develop a networked system of two distinct platforms. The first is a purebred air superiority fighter (a conceptual "F-23," based on the YF-23 design philosophy) optimized for speed, range, and stealth to serve as the "killer" in contested airspace. The second is an upgraded "Super F-35," leveraging the F-35's mature sensor fusion and networking capabilities to act as a dedicated "hub" for controlling Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCAs) from a safer, set-back position.
For the U.S. Navy: A Purpose-Built Multirole Fighter. Instead of navalizing a fragile air superiority design, the Navy should develop a new, purpose-built multi-role strike fighter (a conceptual "F-48"). This aircraft would be designed from its inception for the rigors of carrier operations, prioritizing the attributes the Navy truly needs: long range, a large internal payload, structural robustness for high sortie rates, and superior low-speed handling.
This proposed realignment offers a more lethal, resilient, and fiscally responsible path forward. It allows each service to procure an aircraft optimized for its unique mission without the debilitating compromises inherent in the current plans. It de-risks development by separating conflicting design requirements and leverages the massive existing investment in the F-35 program. This report recommends that the Department of Defense and Congress initiate an immediate strategic review to re-scope the NGAD and F/A-XX programs according to these principles. A course correction now will prevent the fielding of two deeply flawed weapon systems and ensure American air power remains dominant for decades to come.
Introduction: A Tale of Two Doctrines - The Divergent Paths of Air Force and Naval Air Power
To comprehend the fundamental flaws in the current developmental trajectories of the United States Air Force (USAF) and United States Navy (USN) sixth-generation fighter programs, one must first understand the distinct doctrinal philosophies that have shaped their respective approaches to air power for nearly a century. These are not arbitrary service preferences but deeply ingrained strategic cultures forged in different operational crucibles: the limitless expanse of the sky for the Air Force, and the unforgiving, finite deck of an aircraft carrier for the Navy. The current programs represent a startling and dangerous inversion of these historical doctrines, threatening to procure aircraft that are exquisitely designed for the other service's mission.
The USAF's Unwavering Pursuit of Air Superiority
The United States Air Force, from its inception as the Army Air Corps to its status as an independent service, has been animated by a singular, foundational belief: control of the air is the prerequisite for victory in modern warfare. This is not merely one mission among many; it is the central tenet from which all other capabilities flow. As General William W. Momyer, a distinguished fighter pilot and former commander of Tactical Air Command, stated, "The contest for air superiority is the most important contest of all, for no other operations can be sustained if this battle is lost". This doctrine posits that without freedom from enemy air attack and the freedom to attack from the air, land and sea forces cannot maneuver, logistics cannot flow, and the joint force commander cannot achieve strategic objectives.
This doctrinal imperative has directly shaped the USAF's premier fighter aircraft programs. Early "pursuit" aircraft were designed to hunt and destroy enemy bombers, but the lessons of World War II, Korea, and Vietnam solidified the need for a dedicated air superiority fighter—an aircraft designed specifically to seize tactical dominance over an opposing air force. The ultimate expression of this philosophy in the fourth generation was the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle. The F-15 was conceived under the uncompromising mantra of "not a pound for air-to-ground," a clear declaration of its specialized purpose. Its design prioritized unprecedented maneuverability, acceleration, range, and advanced avionics, all geared toward a single outcome: to outperform and outfight any potential adversary aircraft. While the F-15 airframe later proved adaptable enough to evolve into the formidable F-15E Strike Eagle multi-role fighter, its origin and core identity were rooted in pure air-to-air combat.
The F-22 Raptor represents the fifth-generation apotheosis of this doctrine. It was the direct result of the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) program, initiated to ensure American air dominance well into the 21st century. The F-22's design is a synergistic combination of stealth, supercruise (the ability to sustain supersonic flight without afterburners), extreme maneuverability afforded by thrust-vectoring engines, and integrated avionics. Each of these revolutionary capabilities was optimized to achieve a "first-look, first-shot, first-kill" advantage against any and all advanced air threats, cementing its role as the world's preeminent air dominance fighter. The F-22 is not a jack-of-all-trades; it is the master of one, the physical embodiment of the Air Force's core belief in the primacy of air superiority.
The Navy's Imperative for Multi-Role Versatility
The U.S. Navy's air power doctrine evolved under a completely different set of constraints, dictated by the physical and operational realities of the aircraft carrier. The carrier is a sovereign, mobile airbase, but it is also a world of profound limitations: finite deck space, limited hangar capacity, and a finite number of aircraft that can be brought to the fight. These constraints have historically rendered the concept of a large fleet of single-mission aircraft an unaffordable luxury. From the outset, naval aviation demanded versatility.
This imperative for multi-role capability is woven into the fabric of naval aircraft design. The F-4 Phantom II, while originally developed as a naval fleet defense interceptor, quickly proved its mettle as a potent fighter-bomber, becoming a legendary multi-role platform for the Navy, Marine Corps, and, ironically, the Air Force, which became its largest operator. The F-4's success underscored the value of a single, robust platform that could perform multiple missions.
This philosophy was perfected in the F/A-18 Hornet. Its very designation—"F/A" for Fighter/Attack—codified its dual-role nature. The Hornet was designed from the ground up to be a highly versatile aircraft, capable of fighter escort, fleet air defense, suppression of enemy air defenses, air interdiction, and close air support. It was among the first aircraft to heavily utilize multifunction displays, allowing a pilot to switch between roles at the push of a button. The subsequent F/A-18E/F Super Hornet further enhanced this concept, increasing range, payload, and carrier suitability to become the undisputed workhorse and backbone of the modern carrier air wing. For the Navy, the ideal combat aircraft is not the specialized rapier of the Air Force, but the versatile and reliable cutlass, capable of handling any task required by the carrier strike group commander.
A Dangerous Inversion
This analysis proceeds from a critical observation: the current development paths of the USAF NGAD and Navy F/A-XX programs represent a fundamental inversion of these time-tested doctrines. The Air Force's NGAD program, intended to replace the F-22, is described as a "family of systems" in which the manned fighter (the "F-47") is not just a "killer" but also a "hub" for command, control, and communications, managing a fleet of uncrewed aircraft. This blending of roles dilutes the singular focus on air dominance that has defined its most successful fighters.
Simultaneously, the Navy's F/A-XX program, meant to replace the multi-role F/A-18, is being conceptually depicted as a sleek, tailless, high-performance aircraft strongly resembling the YF-23 air superiority prototype. This suggests a design optimized for speed, range, and stealth—the hallmarks of a specialized interceptor—rather than the versatile, jack-of-all-trades workhorse the Navy has always required.
This doctrinal inversion is not an arbitrary mistake but a symptom of both services struggling to adapt to the complexities of the future battlefield. The USAF, having already invested heavily in the F-35 as a multi-role strike and sensor platform, is now attempting to solve the vast, network-centric challenge of Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) by loading these responsibilities onto its next air superiority fighter. This leads to an overemphasis on the "hub" role, compromising the "killer" function. The Navy, meanwhile, is fixated on the threat of long-range anti-ship missiles in the Indo-Pacific, driving a requirement for a long-range, high-endurance interceptor to expand the carrier's defensive perimeter. This pushes them toward a specialized air superiority design, a role fundamentally at odds with the multi-mission demands and engineering realities of carrier aviation. In essence, each service is trying to build the other's traditional aircraft, setting both programs on a path toward doctrinally misaligned and technologically compromised outcomes.

Table 1: Doctrinal and Platform Lineage Comparison. This table illustrates the historical alignment of doctrine and platform design for each service, contrasts it with the current inverted development paths, and presents the proposed realignment as a logical correction.
Part I: The Proposed Force Structure - A Return to Specialization and Purpose-Built Design
The foundational argument of this report is that the current misalignment in next-generation fighter development can and must be corrected. The solution lies not in incremental adjustments but in a strategic realignment that returns each service to its doctrinal strengths. This involves envisioning a force structure where aircraft are designed from their inception to excel at their primary missions, free from the compromises that plague the current NGAD and F/A-XX concepts. The proposed structure is not a rejection of advanced technology but a more logical and effective application of it, creating a system for the Air Force and a platform for the Navy that are both more lethal and more sustainable.
For the U.S. Air Force: A Disaggregated Air Dominance System
The future of air dominance in a peer-competitor environment will not be won by a single "silver bullet" platform but by a resilient, networked "family of capabilities". The Air Force's own Air Superiority 2030 Flight Plan recognized this, calling for an integrated mix of stand-off and stand-in forces. The critical error in the current "F-47" concept is the attempt to merge the stand-in "killer" and the stand-off "hub" into a single, compromised airframe. The logical alternative is to disaggregate these functions into two specialized platforms, each optimized for its role, operating as a cohesive system.
The "Killer": "F-23" for Penetrating Counter-Air
The primary role of the F-22's successor must be to penetrate the most heavily defended enemy airspace and establish air superiority. This "Penetrating Counter-Air" (PCA) mission requires an aircraft optimized for three core attributes above all others: all-aspect stealth, sustained high speed (supercruise), and long range. The ideal design philosophy for such an aircraft already exists in the form of the Northrop YF-23 prototype from the original ATF competition.
Though the YF-22 was ultimately selected, the YF-23 was widely acknowledged to be faster, stealthier, and have a longer range. Its design, featuring a blended wing-body, V-tail, and shielded engine exhausts, was a masterclass in reducing radar and infrared signatures from all aspects, making it a platform seemingly designed for the beyond-visual-range (BVR) combat of the 21st century. While it sacrificed some of the YF-22's extreme low-speed maneuverability by forgoing thrust vectoring, its focus on high-speed efficiency and signature control made it arguably the superior platform for the PCA mission.
A new USAF "killer," conceptually designated the "F-23," would embody this design philosophy from the ground up, leveraging modern materials and adaptive cycle engines to create the ultimate air dominance platform. Its sole purpose would be to hunt and destroy enemy air assets and integrated air defense systems, unburdened by the conflicting requirements of battle management. The viability of this design approach is tacitly acknowledged by the Navy's own F/A-XX concept art, which often depicts a tailless, YF-23-like airframe—a perfect design for the Air Force's mission, but a deeply flawed one for the Navy's.
The "Hub": "Super F-35" for Battle Management
The command-and-control and drone-management functions currently envisioned for the "F-47" should be assigned to a separate, dedicated platform. This does not necessitate the development of a second, entirely new manned aircraft. The ideal platform for this "hub" role already exists in the USAF inventory: the F-35A Lightning II. The F-35 is, by design, the most advanced sensor fusion and networking node in the sky, capable of collecting, processing, and sharing vast amounts of battlefield information.
The "Super F-35" concept would leverage this inherent strength through a dedicated upgrade path, likely an evolution of the current Block 4 modernization program. This upgrade would focus on enhancing its processing power, data links, and electronic warfare suite, specifically to enable a single pilot to effectively command multiple Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCAs). Operating from a set-back position behind the forward edge of the battle, the "Super F-35" would act as the quarterback, directing the "F-23" killers and CCA drones to achieve the commander's intent. This disaggregation creates a more resilient system, as the high-value C2 asset is not placed at the same extreme risk as the penetrating fighter, mitigating the danger of a single-point failure.
This approach is also a de-risked and cost-effective evolution, not a revolution. The F-35 program represents a colossal investment, with projected lifecycle costs exceeding $1.58 trillion. The Block 4 upgrade is already a major program in its own right, with a budget of over $16.5 billion intended to enhance the aircraft's core computing and mission systems. The "Super F-35" concept channels this existing investment toward what the F-35 already does best, making it a far more fiscally and technologically prudent path than developing a single, hyper-complex "F-47" that must be a master of two conflicting domains.
For the U.S. Navy: The "F-48" Multirole Carrier Workhorse
The Navy's primary need is not for a specialized, high-performance interceptor that will be compromised by navalization. It needs a versatile, robust, and long-range workhorse to replace the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and to operate effectively in the vast distances of the Indo-Pacific theater. This requires a new aircraft, designed from day one with the specific, unforgiving demands of carrier aviation as its central design principle.
This conceptual aircraft, the "F-48," would not be a navalized version of the USAF's "F-47." Instead, it represents a more intelligent approach: extracting the valuable next-generation technologies being developed for the NGAD and F/A-XX programs and integrating them into a purpose-built naval airframe. These technologies include advanced adaptive-cycle derivative engines for greater fuel efficiency and thermal management, powerful new sensors, open-architecture mission systems, and the ability to team with uncrewed platforms like the MQ-25 Stingray and future CCAs.
However, these technologies would be housed in an airframe optimized for the Navy's true requirements. The "F-48" design would prioritize:
Long Range and Payload: A large internal fuel fraction and spacious internal weapons bays to carry a significant load of long-range anti-ship and air-to-air missiles, maximizing the carrier's striking power and combat radius without relying on drag-inducing external stores.
Structural Robustness: An airframe and landing gear engineered from the start to withstand thousands of catapult launches and arrested landings, ensuring high reliability and the ability to generate high sortie rates during sustained operations.
Superior Low-Speed Handling: Aerodynamics, including a larger wing area, designed to provide excellent stability and control during the critical carrier approach phase of flight, enhancing safety in all weather conditions.
This "F-48" would be the true successor to the F/A-18, embodying the naval doctrine of multi-role versatility while incorporating the technological leaps of the sixth generation. It would provide the carrier strike group commander with a resilient, long-range, and lethal platform capable of executing the full spectrum of missions, from fleet air defense to deep strike.
Part II: The Frankenstein Effect - The Perils of Compromised Design
The central flaw in the current NGAD and F/A-XX development paths is what can be termed the "Frankenstein Effect": the attempt to stitch together fundamentally incompatible design characteristics into a single airframe, resulting in a monstrous creation that performs neither of its intended roles optimally. A high-performance supercruiser is an aerodynamic thoroughbred; a carrier-based aircraft is a structural workhorse. A penetrating fighter is a sleek weapon; a command-and-control hub is a flying data center. Attempting to merge these opposing concepts creates a cascade of engineering compromises that degrade performance, increase risk, and inflate costs. This section will provide a detailed technical analysis of these penalties, grounding the "Frankenstein Effect" in concrete engineering principles and historical precedent.
The Penalty of Navalizing a Supercruiser (The F/A-XX Problem)
The concept of taking a design optimized for extreme speed, altitude, and all-aspect stealth—like the YF-23-inspired F/A-XX—and adapting it for carrier operations is fraught with profound engineering challenges. The process of "navalization" is not a matter of simply adding a tailhook; it is a fundamental redesign that imposes severe penalties on weight, aerodynamics, and stealth, compromising the very attributes that made the original design desirable.
Structural Reinforcement and Weight Penalties
The single greatest challenge is accommodating the immense structural loads of carrier operations. A land-based aircraft performs a gentle flare to touch down on a long runway. A carrier-based aircraft executes what is essentially a controlled crash, slamming onto a pitching deck at a high sink rate to ensure its tailhook catches an arresting wire. The launch is equally violent, with a steam or electromagnetic catapult accelerating a multi-ton aircraft from zero to over 150 miles per hour in under three seconds, subjecting the airframe to forces of 3 to 4 Gs.
To withstand thousands of these brutal cycles, a naval aircraft requires a significantly strengthened internal structure, a massively reinforced undercarriage, and a robust tailhook assembly. Furthermore, the need to conserve space on the carrier deck necessitates complex and heavy wing-folding mechanisms. These modifications add a tremendous amount of weight. The F-35 program provides a stark, real-world example: the carrier-capable F-35C has an empty weight of 34,500 pounds, a full 5,500 pounds heavier than the 29,000-pound land-based F-35A. This weight penalty is a direct consequence of its larger, folding wings and its beefed-up landing gear designed for carrier landings. In aircraft design, weight is the ultimate enemy. Every kilogram added for navalization is a kilogram that cannot be allocated to fuel, weapons, or performance-enhancing systems, creating a cascading series of negative trade-offs.
Aerodynamic and Performance Degradation
The weight penalty is compounded by aerodynamic compromises. A key requirement for carrier aircraft is safe handling at very low approach speeds. This necessitates a larger wing area to generate sufficient lift. The F-35C's wing area is 668 square feet, over 45% larger than the F-35A's 460 square feet. While this larger wing improves low-speed stability and can enhance sustained turn rates, it is an aerodynamic anchor at high speeds. It generates significantly more parasite and wave drag in the transonic and supersonic regimes, directly undermining the "supercruise" capability that is a hallmark of an air superiority design.
Furthermore, the heavier, strengthened airframe cannot withstand the same maneuvering loads as its lighter, land-based counterpart. This is again demonstrated by the F-35: the F-35A is rated for 9g maneuvers, placing it on par with other agile fighters, while the F-35C is limited to just 7.5g. This is not a minor difference; it represents a significant reduction in instantaneous combat maneuverability. History is replete with examples of this trade-off. The British Supermarine Seafire, a navalized version of the legendary Spitfire, was a capable carrier fighter, but its added weight and structural reinforcements made it a more challenging aircraft to land and compromised its performance relative to its land-based progenitor. To take a design whose essence is extreme kinematic performance and burden it with the weight and aerodynamic penalties of navalization is to create a platform that is a master of neither domain.
Stealth Compromises
For a sixth-generation fighter, where all-aspect, very-low-observability (VLO) is paramount, the compromises of navalization are particularly severe. A stealthy design relies on the precise shaping of surfaces and the elimination of gaps, seams, and right-angle reflections that can return radar energy. Carrier-specific features are anathema to this principle.
The large, complex mechanisms for folding wings create significant seams and breaks in the aircraft's planform alignment. The reinforced, heavy-duty landing gear requires larger, thicker doors with more complex seals, creating potential radar reflection points. The arresting hook itself is a major non-stealthy appendage, and the structural hardpoints required for catapult launch bars disrupt the clean underside of the fuselage. These are not trivial issues; they can fundamentally degrade an aircraft's VLO signature, particularly from the side and rear aspects. The immense difficulty and cost of mitigating these issues were primary reasons why the proposed naval variant of the F-22 (the NATF-22) was abandoned. The required variable-sweep wings were deemed a fatal compromise to its stealth design, rendering the entire concept unviable.
The Penalty of Blending a Killer and a Hub (The "F-47" Problem)
The Air Force's current NGAD concept suffers from a different but equally debilitating "Frankenstein Effect": the attempt to merge the conflicting design requirements of a frontline penetrating fighter (the "killer") and a data-processing, network-management aircraft (the "hub"). This conceptual blend forces trade-offs that will result in an aircraft that is neither as lethal as a dedicated fighter nor as effective as a dedicated command-and-control platform.
Aerodynamics vs. Internal Volume
The design drivers for these two roles are in direct opposition. A "killer" platform, like the F-22 or the conceptual "F-23," is an exercise in aerodynamic optimization. Its shape is dictated by the need to minimize drag for high speed and efficient supercruise, and to reduce its radar cross-section. This results in a design that is sleek, sharp-edged, and prioritizes external form over internal volume.
A "hub" platform, in contrast, is fundamentally an airborne data center. Its primary design driver is the need for massive internal volume to house the necessary hardware for its mission: powerful computer processors, extensive memory, high-capacity data links, and, most critically, the enormous thermal management systems required to cool this high-performance electronics suite. The heat generated by the avionics needed to fuse data from multiple sensors and control a swarm of CCAs is a monumental engineering challenge. Forcing these voluminous requirements into a sleek, low-drag airframe creates an insoluble conflict. The result is a compromise: an aircraft that is bulkier and less aerodynamically efficient than a pure fighter, yet lacks the space for the cooling and power generation of a dedicated C2 platform.
Mission Risk and Single-Point Failure
Beyond the design compromises, blending these roles creates an unacceptable tactical risk. The "killer" mission requires penetrating deep into the most contested, high-threat airspace. The "hub" mission involves managing the "combat cloud," a high-value command-and-control function. Placing both in the same cockpit creates a single point of failure with catastrophic potential.
If a single "F-47" is shot down, the joint force loses not only a pilot and a multi-hundred-million-dollar aircraft, but also the C2 node for its entire retinue of CCA drones. The loss of that single platform could cause an entire local offensive to collapse. A disaggregated system, where the "Super F-35" hub operates from the comparative safety of a set-back orbit while the "F-23" killer and its drones press the attack, is inherently more resilient. This distributed command-and-control architecture can absorb losses without a catastrophic failure of the entire system, a critical attribute for sustained combat operations against a peer adversary. The current "F-47" concept, by concentrating maximum capability into a single platform, also concentrates maximum risk.
The F-35 program itself serves as the ultimate real-world case study for both of these "Frankenstein" problems. The quantifiable performance differences between the F-35C and F-35A—the weight gain, the G-limit reduction, the larger wings—are a direct demonstration of the penalties of navalization. At the same time, the F-35's design is an inherent compromise between a fighter and a hub. While it is an unparalleled sensor and networking platform, its kinematic performance is not on par with a dedicated air superiority fighter like the F-22. The USAF's pursuit of an "F-47" that is simultaneously a better killer and a better hub than the F-35 is an attempt to solve the F-35's compromises by doubling down on them in a single, even more complex and expensive airframe, thereby exacerbating the very problem it seeks to solve.

Part III: Comparative Analysis - A Superior Return on Investment
A strategic realignment of the NGAD and F/A-XX programs is not merely an exercise in doctrinal purity; it represents a demonstrably superior path in terms of combat effectiveness, system resilience, and long-term financial return on investment. A simple comparison of platform "sticker prices" is insufficient. A true analysis must consider the total cost of developing and sustaining these complex systems, the programmatic risks involved, and the ultimate value they deliver to the warfighter. When viewed through this lens, the proposed force structure—a disaggregated system for the Air Force and a purpose-built workhorse for the Navy—is a far more prudent and powerful investment than the current trajectory toward compromised, "Frankenstein" aircraft.
USAF System Analysis (Proposed "F-23 + Super F-35" vs. Current "F-47")
The comparison for the Air Force is not between single aircraft, but between two competing system architectures for achieving air dominance. The current "F-47" concept represents a consolidated architecture, while the proposed "F-23 + Super F-35" model represents a disaggregated one.
Combat Effectiveness
The history of air combat demonstrates that specialized aircraft consistently outperform multi-role platforms in their designated role. The proposed disaggregated system leverages this principle. The "F-23," freed from the burdens of battle management, can be optimized entirely for the air dominance mission. Its design can prioritize the kinematic performance, stealth, and sensor suite needed to defeat advanced peer adversaries in highly contested airspace, making it a more lethal PCA platform.
Simultaneously, the "Super F-35" hub, operating from a less contested environment, can more effectively manage the "combat cloud." Its pilot can dedicate their full cognitive capacity to orchestrating the actions of multiple CCAs, processing intelligence, and coordinating with other joint assets, unburdened by the immense task-saturation of simultaneously flying and fighting on the front lines. This division of labor aligns with emerging USAF operational concepts like Agile Combat Employment (ACE) and distributed lethality, which rely on networked, dispersed assets to create multiple dilemmas for an adversary. The consolidated "F-47" model, by forcing one pilot in one cockpit to be both the premier fighter and the premier battle manager, risks mediocrity in both roles.
System Resilience
The disaggregated model is also inherently more resilient. The consolidated "F-47" system architecture concentrates its highest-value capabilities—the penetrating fighter and the C2 node—into a single platform, creating a critical vulnerability. In a conflict with a peer adversary, the U.S. must assume that it will suffer combat losses. The loss of a single "F-47" results in the simultaneous loss of the manned fighter and the control node for its uncrewed wingmen, potentially causing a localized collapse of capability.
The "F-23 + Super F-35" system distributes this risk. The two key manned components are geographically and functionally separated. The loss of a forward "F-23" is a serious blow, but the "Super F-35" hub can remain on station to direct other assets. Conversely, if a "Super F-35" is threatened or lost, the "F-23s" can continue to fight using their own organic systems or be re-tasked by another C2 node. This distributed control architecture is far more robust and can degrade gracefully under attack, a vital characteristic in a contested electronic warfare environment.
Financial Viability
The financial case for the disaggregated system is compelling, focusing on total program cost and risk rather than just the unit cost of the primary fighter. The manned NGAD fighter is projected to be staggeringly expensive, with credible estimates placing the unit cost at "$300 million apiece" or even higher, and requiring over $20 billion more in R&D to complete.
The proposed model reallocates this investment more intelligently. It involves the development of one new, high-end aircraft (the "F-23") and a major upgrade to an existing, in-production platform (the "Super F-35"). While the "F-23" would undoubtedly be expensive, the cost of the "Super F-35" would primarily consist of the R&D and procurement associated with an advanced mission systems upgrade. This leverages the trillions of dollars already invested in the F-35's development, production, and global logistics infrastructure. The R&D for the "hub" role would be an extension of the existing F-35 Block 4 modernization effort, a program already budgeted for over $16.5 billion. This avoids the immense cost and risk of developing a second, entirely new manned airframe.
Furthermore, lifecycle costs are likely to be more manageable. A specialized "F-23" airframe, while complex, is less likely to suffer from the compounding maintenance challenges of a blended design that must sustain both a high-performance engine and a massive, power-hungry avionics and cooling suite. By using the mature F-35 sustainment enterprise for the "hub" component, the Air Force can capitalize on economies of scale and a well-understood logistics chain, which is critical given the F-35's already high and rising sustainment costs. The disaggregated approach thus offers the potential for a lower total system acquisition cost and a more predictable, sustainable lifecycle cost profile.

USN Feasibility Analysis (Proposed "F-48" vs. Current F/A-XX)
For the Navy, the analysis centers on the feasibility and long-term value of procuring a purpose-built platform versus adapting a non-native design. The argument is that the purpose-built "F-48" offers a significantly better return on investment through lower technical risk, superior doctrinal alignment, and more favorable lifecycle characteristics.
Technological Feasibility
The "F-48" concept is a technologically de-risked approach. It does not require inventing entirely new subsystems. Instead, it proposes the integration of the next-generation technologies already under development for the NGAD/F/A-XX programs—such as advanced derivative engines, powerful sensors, and open-architecture networking—into a new but fundamentally conventional carrier-capable airframe. The primary engineering challenge lies in the design of a robust, carrier-suitable airframe, a discipline in which the U.S. aerospace industry has decades of unparalleled experience.
In contrast, navalizing a YF-23-style F/A-XX concept presents an unprecedented and high-risk technological challenge. It would require a near-total redesign of the airframe to handle carrier loads, the invention of novel methods to make a VLO planform compatible with folding wings and arresting gear, and solving the aerodynamic puzzle of achieving good low-speed handling without crippling the aircraft's high-speed performance. This path is laden with "unknown unknowns" and is a recipe for the kind of massive cost overruns and schedule delays that plagued the F-35 program.
Doctrinal Alignment
The "F-48" aligns perfectly with the Navy's enduring need for a multi-role workhorse. It would be the true successor to the F/A-18, providing the carrier strike group commander with the flexible, high-payload, long-range asset required for the vast majority of naval aviation missions. In the context of the Indo-Pacific, its ability to carry a large internal load of long-range weapons would be critical for projecting power and defending the fleet against A2/AD threats. The F/A-XX concept, as a specialized interceptor, is a niche capability. A carrier commander would almost always prefer the flexibility of the "F-48" over a platform that excels in a narrow air-to-air role but is compromised in the strike, surface warfare, and support missions that constitute the daily business of a carrier air wing.
Financial Return on Investment (ROI)
The financial case for the "F-48" hinges on a holistic view of total ownership cost. While the upfront R&D for a new, purpose-built aircraft is significant, it is likely to be a more predictable and manageable expense than the open-ended and high-risk cost of navalizing the F/A-XX. The latter would be a continuous battle against physics and engineering trade-offs, almost certainly leading to spiraling costs.
The long-term ROI of the "F-48" would be far superior. By being designed from the ground up for the harsh maritime and carrier environment, it would be inherently more reliable and easier to maintain than a delicate, compromised air superiority design. This would translate directly into higher availability and sortie generation rates—the ultimate metrics of a carrier aircraft's value. A fleet of reliable "F-48s" that can consistently put ordnance on target will provide a far better return on investment than a fleet of exquisite, high-maintenance F/A-XX aircraft that are frequently unavailable for missions. A purpose-built solution, though expensive, is ultimately more cost-effective than buying the wrong tool for the job and paying an additional premium to make it barely fit.

Table 4: Comparative Return on Investment Analysis (USN). This table highlights how the extreme technical risk and poor doctrinal fit of navalizing the F/A-XX lead to a poor long-term ROI, while the purpose-built "F-48" offers a more reliable, effective, and sustainable solution aligned with the Navy's core mission.
Conclusion and Recommendations
The current development paths for the next generation of American air power are leading toward a future force that is doctrinally incoherent, technologically compromised, and fiscally unsustainable. The "Frankenstein Effect"—the attempt to merge incompatible design requirements—is poised to deliver an "F-47" to the Air Force that is a less effective air dominance fighter due to its C2 burdens, and an F/A-XX to the Navy that is a less capable multi-role platform due to the debilitating penalties of navalization. This is a strategic error of the highest order, one that will cede advantages to peer competitors and waste hundreds of billions in taxpayer dollars.
The findings of this analysis are clear: a strategic realignment based on the principles of doctrinal fidelity and design specialization offers a superior path forward.
For the Air Force, disaggregating the air dominance mission into a specialized "F-23" killer and a "Super F-35" hub creates a more lethal, resilient, and financially prudent system. It allows each platform to excel at its designated role, enhances overall system survivability through distributed control, and intelligently leverages the massive existing investment in the F-35 program.
For the Navy, developing a purpose-built "F-48" multi-role workhorse is a lower-risk, higher-reward strategy. It aligns perfectly with the Navy's operational needs, avoids the immense technical and financial risks of navalizing a non-native supercruiser, and promises a more reliable and sustainable platform that can generate the sortie rates required for sustained carrier operations.
This proposed force structure is better suited for the challenges of future conflict, particularly a potential peer contest in the Indo-Pacific. The USAF's disaggregated system provides the resilient, penetrating capability needed to dismantle advanced integrated air defense systems, while the Navy's long-range, high-payload "F-48" provides the carrier strike group with the organic power projection and defensive reach it will require in that vast theater.
Continuing on the current path is an exercise in repeating the most costly mistakes of past acquisition programs. The time for a course correction is now, before these flawed concepts are locked into irreversible engineering and manufacturing development phases.
Recommendations:
Initiate a Joint Strategic Review: The Secretary of Defense should direct an immediate, high-level strategic review of the USAF NGAD and USN F/A-XX programs. This review should explicitly challenge the current operational requirements and explore alternative force structure concepts, with the findings of this report serving as a foundational baseline.
Re-scope Program Requirements based on Doctrinal Alignment: Congress, through the National Defense Authorization Act, should mandate that the Air Force and Navy re-scope their respective program requirements to align with their core doctrines.
The USAF NGAD program should be restructured to prioritize the development of a disaggregated system, separating the acquisition of a Penetrating Counter-Air platform from the C2/CCA-management function, which should be pursued as an upgrade path for the F-35A.
The USN F/A-XX program should be re-scoped to focus on the development of a new, purpose-built multi-role strike fighter designed from inception for carrier operations, explicitly rejecting the concept of navalizing a land-based air superiority design.
A decision to alter the course of these multi-billion-dollar programs will require significant political and institutional will. However, the cost of inaction—of proceeding down a path that promises to deliver two compromised, doctrinally misaligned, and exorbitant weapon systems—is far greater. The security of the nation in the decades to come depends on making the right choices today.
